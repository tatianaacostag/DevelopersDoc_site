Offer several payment methods. Discriminate the payments you receive so you can know who pays what and when.  How does the Payment request work? The Payment request follows a simple flow to let your customers buy your products or services using the secure PayU platform:\n  Generate the Payment request through the PayU module. For a basic payment request, you only need to provide what you want to sell, its price, and decide whether your payment includes taxes or an expiration date. If you want to include additional information such as shipping, payment reference, comments, and more, you can create a Custom payment request.\n  Once the link has been generated, you can share it with your customers either by email, posting the link on social networks, or including this link in your website (if you have one).\n  When your customers use the link, they are redirected to the PayU\u0026rsquo;s checkout page, where they can pay using any of the available payment methods.\n  Every time a customer pays using the link, you receive a confirmation message and the amount of the purchase* is transferred to your PayU account, where you can transfer it to your bank account.\n  *The value transferred corresponds to the amount paid by your customer minus the PayU fee.\nCreating payment requests According to your business needs, you can create two types of Payment requests: Basic and Custom.\nA Basic Payment Request lets you create a link just by providing the product\u0026rsquo;s name and price; furthermore, you can decide whether you need to include taxes or whether the link may expire in the future. The Custom Payment Request is a payment link with extra information such as shipping information, payment reference, response pages, comments or narrow down the available payment methods.\nCreate a Basic Payment Request Follow the next procedure to create a Basic Payment Request and share it with your customers.\n  Log in to PayU.com and click the login option located at the top of the page.

If so, select the percentage or fixed amount of the taxes.\n  Payment deadline: choose if the Payment request expires in a given time.

Payment reference: this option lets you decide if you want to set a specific Payment reference for the link.   Transaction redirects: in this option you can set the URLs of the customized response pages you have when a transaction is approved, declined or pending. These fields are not mandatory and if you don\u0026rsquo;t set a URL, the transaction is redirected to the default PayU\u0026rsquo;s response pages.   Buyer comments: this option allows the buyer to add comments related to the purchase. The field where the buyer can add comments can be set in English, Spanish or Portuguese.\nFor example, you can configure this field to let the customer specify a particular description of the product.   Select the available payment methods: this option lets you include or exclude the available payment methods according to your country.

The following section explains these methods.\nTransaction processing PayU provides different operations to process your payments:\n Authorization: this operation is used to verify if the credit card used to pay is active, has funds, etc. The transaction is not complete until a transaction capture is sent.  For Example, when you use a transportation app, after you request the service, the app sends an Authorization to reserve the amount of the trip and verify that your card is valid (active and with enough founds). Nevertheless, the charge is not performed in your card yet. Capture: this operation terminates a previously authorized transaction, namely, at this point, the account makes a debit to the card. Back in the transportation app example, once your service has finished, the apps charges the total amount of your trip and terminates the transaction. Authorization and capture: this operation sends the amount of the transactions to validate (Authorization) and if it is approved, the amount is debited from the card immediately (capture). This is the most common method to process transactions.  Payment methods The available payment methods used to process transactions are:\n Credit cards. Cash or bank payments. Bank transfers.

You can use all possible combinations:\nConsiderations  You must have an active PayU account. You must install a valid SSL certificate in your server and your site must be able to make SSL connections. Due to this, the virtual machine must have appropriate security extensions. Temporarily, do not use security certificates elliptic curve or those who have the suite of encryption TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA in your payment requests. You must have CGI or server languages such as Java, C#, VB, PHP, etc. You must be able to store your authentication credentials (API Key and API Login) safely. The encoding for messages must be UTF-8. The dates must have format yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss, the time format is 24 hours. Example: 2015-08-22T21:35:12. Normally the connection guarantees response times of three seconds on average. If there is an unusual situation, the maximum response time is one minute. It is highly recommended that you set timeouts when you connect with PayU. It is important to validate the length and numbers of credit cards by franchise, together with the security codes.

Once you have created the request, a PayU customer service agent validates the information and the justification of the request to approve it and perform the refund, or deny it if it does not meet the requirements. Additionally, you can check the status of your refund request using the Queries service available for that purpose.\nUnderstanding concepts Before moving on, let\u0026rsquo;s explain the following concepts:\n  Void: this operation reverses a previously authorized transaction.\n  Refund: this operation requests the reversal of a previously captured transaction. Refunds can be requested by the total or the partial amount.\n  Void The VOID method cancels a previously authorized transaction. The void of an order can be total or partial depending on if the acquirer supports partial voids.\nVoid is automatic procedure. As soon as you send the VOID request, it does not follow any approval flow, and the transaction is not charged to the card holder.\nNote VOID method is not available in Colombia and Panama.  Refund A refund is requested when a shop decides to voluntarily return the money spent by the shopper due to dissatisfaction reasons or when the shop does not have enough stock of the product purchased. The REFUND method request the reversal of a previously captured transaction.\nUnlike the VOID method, this method requires an approval. The refund procedure is explained below:\n  When a refund is requested by your customer, you need to request it using the PayU module or the API or SDK integration. The request requires the Order Id, and a refund reason.\n  Once you send the request, PayU reviews the request and approves or rejects it in one to three business days.\n  The REFUND has three states:\n UNRESOLVED: the request has been sent to PayU for approval. At this point, no transaction has been added to the order and when you consult it using the Queries service, the response only shows the transaction of the payment approval. APPROVED: the request has been approved by a PayU\u0026rsquo;s customer service agent. At this point the order has changed its state to CANCELLED or REFUNDEDstate and a PayU adds a REFUND transaction to the order with approved state. DECLINED: the request does not meet the policies defined by PayU and was cancelled by an agent. when the refund is declined, PayU adds a REFUND transaction to the order with declined state.  For more information about authorized and captured transactions, refer to Payments.\nConsiderations Before using either VOID or REFUND feature, take into account the following considerations:\n Refund or Void method are only available for transactions made with a credit card. If the request refers to a different payment means such as cash payment means, bank transfer; the request is declined by PayU´s customer service agent. PayU only creates one application for each refund request, if a request is repeatedly posted for the same transaction, PayU indicates that the request is already registered. PayU only accepts refund requests of transactions in the Captured state. You can retry the refund request if this was previously declined. Once you make the request, the transaction amount becomes part of the Frozen Balance of your PayU account until it is processed.  If your refund request is APPROVED, the amount is refunded to the card holder. If your refund request is DECLINED, the amount is released from the Frozen Balance and returns to the available Balance of your PayU account.   Once the refund is approved, this will be reflected in the payer\u0026rsquo;s credit card when the bank make it effective.  What\u0026rsquo;s next?
