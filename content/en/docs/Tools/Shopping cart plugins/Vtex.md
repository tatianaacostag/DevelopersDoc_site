Once you have configured the Payment conditions for your payment methods, it is strongly recommended to test your integration before starting to receive real transactions. As a prerequisite, make sure your PaymentsOS account is in `TEST` mode, as well as the _**Environment selector**_ in your _**Gateway affiliation**_.

1. In the VTEX admin, click _**VISIT STORE**_ at the top panel.

![PrintScreen](/assets/VTEX/VTEX_16.png)

![PrintScreen](/assets/VTEX/VTEX_17.png)

![PrintScreen](/assets/VTEX/VTEX_18.png)

4. In the payment section, the payment methods appears grouped by their type. Select the one you want to test and enter the test data, find [here]({{< ref "Test-your-solution.md#test-cards" >}}) some test card numbers and information to test status.<br>
Finally, click in Complete purchase

![PrintScreen](/assets/VTEX/VTEX_19.png)

Once the purchase has been approved you can check it in:
* VTEX Admin: _**Payments**_ > _**Transactions**_.

![PrintScreen](/assets/VTEX/VTEX_20.png)

* PaymentsOS dashboard: _**Payments**_ > _**Search**_.<br><br>![PrintScreen](/assets/VTEX/VTEX_21.png)<br>The parameter _**External Transaction ID**_ inside the _**Transaction Activity**_ is the Order ID in PayU.  

* PayU Module: in the [_**Sales Report**_]({{< ref "Sales-report.md" >}}) module.

![PrintScreen](/assets/VTEX/VTEX_22.png)

* [Queries API]({{< ref "Queries.md" >}}) using the parameter _**External Transaction ID**_ as OrderID.

### Testing two-step flows
When you have configured your _**Gateway affiliation**_ to process transactions in two-step flows, the funds authorized in the credit card are not settled until you explicitly request the settlement. To request the settlement, you need to invoice the order.

To invoice an order, locate the transaction in the VTEX Admin (**Payments**_ > _**Transactions**_) and click it. Then, click the _**Order**_ button at the top right corner.

![PrintScreen](/assets/VTEX/VTEX_23.png)

Scroll down to the Package section, and click _**Invoice package**_.

![PrintScreen](/assets/VTEX/VTEX_24.png)

Provide the information of the invoice and click _**Send Invoice**_ at the end of the panel. Once the invoice is sent to the customer, the amount authorized is charged fom the customer's card.

![PrintScreen](/assets/VTEX/VTEX_25.png)

{{% alert title="Note" color="info"%}}
An authorized order can be cancelled using the _**Cancel order**_ button in the Order information. When cancelling the order, PayU send a _void_ transaction which is record both in the Hub and PayU Latam.
