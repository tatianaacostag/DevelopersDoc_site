osCommerce is a platform developed in PHP that ease the creation of an online store. To let your **clients** pay with PayU from your website, you need to install the plugin for osCommerce, which integrates PayU Latam as a valid payment gateway. For more information about osCommerce, refer to their [official website](https://www.oscommerce.com/).

## Prerequisites
* You need an active account in PayU Latam.
* Having installed [osCommerce version 2.3](https://www.oscommerce.com/Products).
* Having the PayU's osCommerce plugin downloaded and stored in an accessible location. Click [here](https://github.com/developers-payu-latam/developers-payu-latam.github.io/raw/master/plugins/plugin-oscommerce.zip) to download it.

## Installation
Follow the next procedure to install the plugin on your website.

1. Unzip the plugin file in a location of your choice. From now on, we will refer this location to ```[PLUGIN_PATH]```. <br>
In this path, you find the folder ```oscommerce-plugin-1.0```.

2. Either using FTP or logging in as an Administrator to the server where osCommerce is installed, include the plugin files in the server as follows:

* In the server path ```/[server]/apache/[publication_path]/oscommerce/catalog```, copy the plugin files ```confirmation_payu.php``` and ```response_payu.php```. These files are located in the path ```[PLUGIN_PATH]\oscommerce-plugin-1.0\oscommerce-payu-latam-1.0\catalog```.

* In the server path ```/[server]/apache/[publication_path]/oscommerce/catalog/includes/languages/english/modules/```, copy the plugin file ```‘payu_latam.php``` located in the path ```[PLUGIN_PATH]\oscommerce-plugin-1.0\oscommerce-payu-latam-1.0\catalog\includes\languages\english\modules\payment```.<br><br>

  Repeat this step for Spanish and Portuguese if you have them installed in your osCommerce website. These files are located in the paths:<br>
  - ES: ```[PLUGIN_PATH]\oscommerce-plugin-1.0\oscommerce-payu-latam-1.0\catalog\includes\languages\espanol\modules\payment```
  - PT: ```[PLUGIN_PATH]\oscommerce-plugin-1.0\oscommerce-payu-latam-1.0\catalog\includes\languages\portugues\modules\payment```
