## How to get variables for integration
Regardless of the integration selected, you may require any of the following variables in the request of the methods.

### API key and API Login
1. Log in to [PayU.com](payu.com) and click the login option located at the top of the page. Alternatively, you can log in to https://merchants.payulatam.com/.

2. Click _**Settings**_ and then select _**Technical configuration**_.

3. In this window, you find both the API key and API Login which allows you to authenticate your commerce during the integration procedure.

Both keys are unique per commerce in PayU, therefore, you must keep this information secured and their usage or disclosure is under your responsibility. 

{{% /alert %}}  

### Authentication signature
The variable `signature` is used to validate the payments performed through the platform, ensuring their authenticity. This variable is a string value encrypted using MD5 or SHA algorithms and follows this structure.

```
ApiKey~merchantId~referenceCode~tx_value~currency
```

Let's build a `signature` using the following test values:

* **ApiKey**: `4Vj8eK4rloUd272L48hsrarnUA`
* **merchantId**: `508029`
* **referenceCode**: `TestPayU`
* **tx_value**: `3`
* **currency**: `USD`

The string is these values concatenated with the tilde character (~):

```
4Vj8eK4rloUd272L48hsrarnUA~508029~TestPayU~3~USD
```

After you apply the MD5 algorithm, the `signature` value is:

```
ba9ffa71559580175585e45ce70b6c37
```

### _deviceSessionId_ variable
The _deviceSessionId_ is a code with the information of the device where the transaction was generated and provides a unique identifier for the device. This variable lets us identify attackers.

1. To perform either API or SDK integration, you need to include the following script in your payment form:

```` HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maf.pagosonline.net/ws/fp/tags.js?id=${deviceSessionId}80200"></script>
<noscript>
   <iframe style="width: 100px; height: 100px; border: 0; position: absolute; top: -5000px;" src="https://maf.pagosonline.net/ws/fp/tags.js?id=${deviceSessionId}80200"></iframe>
</noscript>
````
<br>

2. It is important to generate the `deviceSessionId` per each transaction. To generate the `deviceSessionId` get the `session_id` of the cookie and concatenate it with the current timestamp along with the milliseconds. Then, encrypt the result using MD5.

Example in PHP

```` PHP
$deviceSessionId = md5(session_id().microtime())
````
<br>

For example, if the `$deviceSessionId` is `d66f949f19b33e88c202b579cfc549b3`, the script is as follows:

```` HTML
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://maf.pagosonline.net/ws/fp/tags.js?id=d66f949f19b33e88c202b579cfc549b380200"></script>
<noscript>
	<iframe style="width: 100px; height: 100px; border: 0; position: absolute; top: -5000px;" src="https://maf.pagosonline.net/ws/fp/tags.js?id=d66f949f19b33e88c202b579cfc549b380200"></iframe>
</noscript>
````
<br>

3. Finally, you must send the `$deviceSessionId` in the variable according to the integration selected:

* For **API**: `transaction.deviceSessionId`
* For **SDK JAVA**: `PayU.PARAMETERS.DEVICE_SESSION_ID`
* For **SDK PHP**: `PayUParameters::DEVICE_SESSION_ID`
