#### Considerations
* For payments with credit card tokens, include the parameters `transaction.creditCardTokenId` and `transaction.creditCard.securityCode` replacing the information of the credit card (if you process with security code). For more information, refer to [Tokenization API]({{< ref "Tokenization-API.md" >}}).
* By default, processing credit cards without security code is not enabled. If you want to enable this feature, contact your Sales representative. After this feature is enabled for you, send in the request the variable `creditCard.processWithoutCvv2` as true and remove the variable `creditCard.securityCode`.
* The variable `transaction.threeDomainSecure` does not replace the card information nor any of the mandatory fields of the transaction. This object is additional and not mandatory.
* The variable `transaction.threeDomainSecure` corresponds to a _Pass Through_ scenario where the commerce performs the authentication by their own.
* For Crédito Fácil Codensa card, the number of installments supported are 1 to 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48.
* For Crédito Fácil Codensa card, the variable `transaction.payer.dniType`is mandatory. The payer can choose any of the following document types:

| ISO | Description                                                                         |

|  CE | Foreign citizenship card.                                                           |

#### Considerations
* The parameter `transaction.expirationDate` is not mandatory. If you don't send this parameter, its default value for is seven (7) days after the current date.

* The minimum and maximum values for `BALOTO`, `EFECTY`, and `OTHER_CASH` (Su Red) are:
   - `BALOTO` > Min: $3.000 COP - Max: $1.000.000 COP
   - `EFECTY` > Min: $20.000 COP - Max: $6.000.000 COP
   - `OTHER_CASH` (Su Red) > Min: $1.000 COP - Max: $4.000.000 COP
* The parameter `transactionResponse.extraParameters` has the following parameters related to the transaction:
   - **EXPIRATION_DATE**: maximum term for the payer to perform the payment.   
   - **REFERENCE**: internal payment reference generated by PayU.
   - **URL_PAYMENT_RECEIPT_HTML**: payment receipt in HTML format. This is where you need to redirect the payment when the payer selects cash payment. 
   - **URL_PAYMENT_RECEIPT_PDF**: payment receipt in PDF format.

#### Considerations
* If the payment request is successful, the transaction has state `PENDING` and responseCode `PENDING_TRANSACTION_CONFIRMATION`; this is because the payer is redirected to the selected bank to complete the payment; you must redirect the payer to the URL returned in the extra parameter `BANK_URL`.
* The URL returned in the extra parameter `BANK_URL` is configured in the PayU Module and must show the following information:<br><br>![PrintScreen](/assets/Payments/PSEresponse-en.png)<br>Parameters starting with $ symbol are sent via `GET`.
* You must add in the response page the options to retry the payment, finish the transaction and print the receipt.
* The status displayed in the response page can be any of the following:

| polTransactionState | polResponseCode | State                                                                |
