## Fraud Protection: Best Practices

Online fraud is a constant threat to electronic transaction platforms. Implementing the following security practices helps minimize risks and ensures the protection of customer information:

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Requiring an additional layer of authentication (such as a code sent to a mobile phone or an MFA method) prevents unauthorized individuals from accessing accounts or conducting fraudulent transactions.
- **Advanced Encryption:** Ensure that all communications between the client and server are encrypted using TLS 1.2 or 1.3, protecting sensitive data like credit card information from potential interception.
- **Monitoring Suspicious Transactions:** Use fraud detection algorithms to identify unusual patterns, such as frequent transactions in a short period or transactions from unusual locations.
- **Data Tokenization:** Replace sensitive data, such as card numbers, with randomly generated alphanumeric tokens, protecting information in case of unauthorized access.

## Compliance: PCI DSS and Other International Standards

Adhering to international standards, such as PCI DSS 4.0 (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard), is essential to ensure transaction security and avoid legal sanctions. This standard establishes measures that companies must adopt to protect credit card information.

### Key PCI DSS Requirements:

1. **Secure Network:** Implementation of firewalls and secure passwords.
2. **Cardholder Data Protection:** Encrypted storage of data and limited access to authorized personnel.
3. **Vulnerability Management:** Regular software updates to prevent attacks.
4. **Access Control:** Only necessary employees have access to card information, and this access is monitored.
5. **Continuous Monitoring and Testing:** Periodic audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
6. **Comprehensive Security Policy:** Application of security policies and continuous training for all personnel involved in handling sensitive data.

## Customer Data Integrity

Implementing security best practices, in addition to complying with standards, is essential to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of customer data. Key measures include:

- **Frequent Backups:** Allow system restoration without significant loss in case of an incident.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Limits data access based on employee roles, reducing the risk of misuse.
- **Transparent Privacy Policy:** Explaining to customers how their data is managed and protected increases their confidence in the platform.

## PCI DSS Compliance Levels for Merchants

Organizations that process card transactions are grouped into four levels based on their annual transaction volume, determining compliance requirements.

| **Compliance Level** | **Annual Transaction Volume**   | **Requirements**               |
|-|-|-|
| **Level 1** | Over 6 million transactions with MasterCard or Visa, or over 2.5 million transactions with American Express | <li> Annual external audit (QSA) <br> <li> Quarterly vulnerability scan (ASV) <br> <li> Annual compliance report (AOC and ROC) |
| **Level 2** | Between 1 and 6 million transactions | <li> Annual self-assessment (SAQ) or external audit <br> <li> Quarterly vulnerability scan (ASV) |
| **Level 3** | Between 20,000 and 1 million transactions | <li> Annual self-assessment (SAQ) <br> <li> Quarterly vulnerability scan (ASV) |
| **Level 4** | Less than 20,000 transactions | <li> Annual self-assessment (SAQ) <br> <li> Quarterly vulnerability scan (ASV, as required by the acquiring bank) |

## PCI DSS Compliance Levels for Service Providers

Service providers are grouped into two levels based on their relevance and transaction volume:

| **Compliance Level** | **Annual Transaction Volume** | **Assessment Requirements** |
|-|-|--|
| **Level 1** | Over 300,000 transactions or those considered critical | <li> Annual audit by a QSA or ISA <br> <li> Quarterly vulnerability tests (ASV) <br> <li> Annual penetration testing |
| **Level 2** | Less than 300,000 transactions | <li> Self-assessment questionnaire (SAQ) <br> <li> Quarterly vulnerability tests (ASV) |

### Assessment Methods:

- **Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ):** Self-assessment to validate compliance for lower-level merchants and providers.
- **Report on Compliance (RoC):** Annual audit for Level 1 providers, documenting compliance.
- **Attestation of Compliance (AoC):** Signed document confirming PCI DSS compliance after an audit or self-assessment.

Companies experiencing a security breach may be reclassified to a higher level, regardless of transaction volume.
