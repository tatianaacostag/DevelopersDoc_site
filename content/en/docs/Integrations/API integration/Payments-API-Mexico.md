#### Considerations
* Two-step flows are only available for Mastercard and Visa.
* For payments with Interest-free months (Meses Sin Intereses - MSI), send the parameters `transaction.monthsWithoutInterest.months` with the number of installments and `transaction.monthsWithoutInterest.bank` with the name of the issuer bank of the credit card. Refer to [MSI]({{< ref "Promotions.md" >}}) (also known as Promotions) for more information.
* The available banks for MSI are: BANAMEX, BANCO REGIONAL DE MONTERREY S.A, BANCOPPEL, BANCO AZTECA, SCOTIABANK, HSBC, INBURSA, BANCA MIFEL SA, BANCO MULTIVA, BAJIO, CI BANCO, Afirme, Banregio, Banjercito, Banorte, Famsa, Invex, Premium Card Liverpool, Santander, and Bancomer
* When using MSI or apply installments, always display the phrase **"PAGOS DIFERIDOS"** during the payment process.
* When installments applied (fees assumed by the payer), display the original amount of the transaction, the total amount after the fees, the number of installments, and the amount per installment including the extra fee.
* Promotions feature is only available for [one-step flows]({{< ref "Payments.md#payment-flows" >}}).
* For payments with credit card tokens, include the parameter `transaction.creditCardTokenId` replacing the information of the credit card. For more information, refer to [Tokenization API]({{< ref "Tokenization.md" >}}).
* By default, processing credit cards without security code is not enabled. If you want to enable this feature, contact your Sales representative. After this feature is enabled for you, send in the request the variable `creditCard.processWithoutCvv2` as true and remove the variable `creditCard.securityCode`.

### Authorization
Use this method to perform the **Authorization** step of a two-step flow using Mastercard or Visa. In this step, you authorize the payment but the amount is not debited until you [capture]({{< ref "payments-api-mexico.md#capture" >}}) the funds.<br>The following are the request and response bodies for this transaction type.

{{< tab tabNum="2" >}}
<br>

Request body:

Response body:

{{< /tabs >}}

### Capture
Use this method to perform the **Capture** step of a two-step flow for mastercard and visa. In this step, you capture the funds previously [Authorized]({{< ref "payments-api-mexico.md#authorization" >}}) to transfer them to your PayU account.

#### Considerations
Take into account the following considerations for capture.
* The maximum time to capture an approved transaction is 14 days. After this time, the transaction is auto voided.
* Only the parameters displayed in the request body are mandatory to invoke a Capture transaction. Recall that the order and transaction ids must meet with a currently authorized transaction.
* You can perform partial captures over an authorized amount. To do this, you need to send in the request the parameter `transaction.order.additionalValues.TX_VALUE` with its value (as sent during the Authorization) and set `PARTIAL_CAPTURE` for `transaction.type`.

The following are the request and response bodies for this transaction type.

### Charge
Use this method to perform a one-step flow, namely a charge. In this step, both steps of the two-step flow are combined in a single transaction and the funds are transferred from the customers account to your PayU account once they have been approved:
