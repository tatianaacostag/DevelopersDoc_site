#### Considerations
* Two-step flows are only available for Mastercard and Visa.
* For payments with Interest-free months (Meses Sin Intereses - MSI), send the parameters `transaction.monthsWithoutInterest.months` with the number of installments and `transaction.monthsWithoutInterest.bank` with the name of the issuer bank of the credit card. Refer to [MSI]({{< ref "Promotions.md" >}}) (also known as Promotions) for more information.
* The available banks for MSI are: BANAMEX, BANCO REGIONAL DE MONTERREY S.A, BANCOPPEL, BANCO AZTECA, SCOTIABANK, HSBC, INBURSA, BANCA MIFEL SA, BANCO MULTIVA, BAJIO, CI BANCO, Afirme, Banregio, Banjercito, Banorte, Famsa, Invex, Premium Card Liverpool, Santander, and Bancomer
* When using MSI or apply installments, always display the phrase **"PAGOS DIFERIDOS"** during the payment process.
* When installments applied (fees assumed by the payer), display the original amount of the transaction, the total amount after the fees, the number of installments, and the amount per installment including the extra fee.
* Promotions feature is only available for [one-step flows]({{< ref "Payments.md#payment-flows" >}}).
* For payments with credit card tokens, include the parameter `transaction.creditCardTokenId` replacing the information of the credit card. For more information, refer to [Tokenization API]({{< ref "Tokenization.md" >}}).
* By default, processing credit cards without security code is not enabled. If you want to enable this feature, contact your Sales representative. After this feature is enabled for you, send in the request the variable `creditCard.processWithoutCvv2` as true and remove the variable `creditCard.securityCode`.

### Authorization
Use this method to perform the **Authorization** step of a two-step flow using Mastercard or Visa. In this step, you authorize the payment but the amount is not debited until you [capture]({{< ref "payments-api-mexico.md#capture" >}}) the funds.<br>The following are the request and response bodies for this transaction type.

### Capture
Use this method to perform the **Capture** step of a two-step flow for Mastercard and Visa. In this step, you capture the funds previously [Authorized]({{< ref "payments-api-mexico.md#authorization" >}}) to transfer them to your PayU account.

#### Considerations
Take into account the following considerations for capture.
* The maximum time to capture an approved transaction is 30 days. After this time, the transaction is auto voided.
* Only the parameters displayed in the request body are mandatory to invoke a Capture transaction. Recall that the order and transaction ids must meet with a currently authorized transaction.
* You can perform partial captures over an authorized amount as long as the partial capture amount does not exceed the authorized amount. To do this, you need to send in the request the parameter `transaction.order.additionalValues.TX_VALUE` with its value (as sent during the Authorization) and set `PARTIAL_CAPTURE` for `transaction.type`.

The following are the request and response bodies for this transaction type.

#### Considerations
* The parameter `transaction.expirationDate` is not mandatory. If you don't send this parameter, its default value for is seven (7) days after the current date.
* When the payment method is `OXXO`, the confirmation of the payment will be one day after the payment. For other cash payment methods, the confirmation is online.
* The parameter `transactionResponse.extraParameters` has the following parameters related to the transaction:
   - **BANK_REFERENCED_CODE**: payment type.
   - **EXPIRATION_DATE**: maximum term for the payer to perform the payment.
   - **BAR_CODE**: barcode which lets the payer perform the payment.
   - **REFERENCE**: internal payment reference generated by PayU. 
   - **URL_PAYMENT_RECEIPT_HTML**: payment receipt in HTML format. This is where you need to redirect the payment when the payer selects cash payment. 
   - **URL_PAYMENT_RECEIPT_PDF**: payment receipt in PDF format.
   - **PAYMENT_WAY_ID**: network payment of the payment type.

#### Considerations
* The parameter `transaction.expirationDate` is not mandatory. If you don't send this parameter, its default value for is seven (7) days after the current date.
* When the payer selects this payment method, PayU creates an order in _in progress_ state and a transaction in `PENDING`state.
* To perform the payment, the payer must log in the virtual branch of their bank (The bank must appear in the list of SPEI available banks). <br>First, the payer must register the PayU CLABE account in their bank branch. Once the PayU CLABE account is enable to perform transfers, the payer must provide the reference returned by PayU in the parameter `trazabilityCode` and the amount as returned by PayU in their virtual branch.
* In the response body, you can find the needed variables to generate the payment receipt (voucher) and the URL of the receipt generated by PayU in HTML and PDF format. If you want to generate the voucher, use the following variables:
  - **trazabilityCode**: unique identifier of maximum 7 digits long; corresponds to the payment reference that the payer must provide in the virtual branch. It is mandatory to enter the same value in the reference field of the bank branch so the payment can be successful.
  - **value**: the payer must enter as transfer amount the same value informed in the request, so the payment can be successful.
  - **SPEI_CLABE_ACCOUNT_NUMBER**: is the PayU's interbank CLABE, namely, the account where the amount will be transferred. The payer must register this CLABE as beneficiary in their bank branch before performing the transfer.
  - **SPEI_BANK_NAME**: name associated with the PayU CLABE account. The beneficiary account is associated with the STP bank and it's always the same bank for PayU.
