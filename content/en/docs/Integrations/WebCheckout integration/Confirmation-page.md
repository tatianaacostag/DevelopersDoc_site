description: >
  This page allows you to get system confirmations related with the transaction results. You can update your system's inventories, orders, or databases. This page is not visible to the customer and its goal is to enable communication between systems. The data is sent via the HTTP POST method. </br>If the payer generates payment retries during the payment process, a confirmation page is generated for each transaction. This page is invoked for approved and rejected states.

The confirmation page lets you update the databases in your system; hence, this page should not include HTML code as it's not visible to the buyer. This page is optional; when a transaction is complete (i.e., when approved, rejected, or when canceled) our platform sends the variables via the HTTP POST method.

In the confirmation page, you must capture the data you want to store in the database. This capture depends on the programming language you use.

## Considerations
* If your site is restricted with _basic access authentication_ or similar, disable it for the confirmation url.
* The IP associated with the confirmation URL should be public; do not use URL accessible from intranet or localhost.
* If you're using HTTPS, you must have a valid certificate.
* Do not use security certificates elliptic curve or those who have the suite of encryption `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA` on your confirmation page.
* PayU assumes that the confirmation page is reported correctly when receives the HTTP 200 code; otherwise, PayU makes a maximum of nine (9) attempts to send the confirmation page to your system. If after these attempts, HTTP 200 code is not received, PayU sends an e-mail alert.
* PayU reports the confirmation page once the transaction has a final status for example, when approved, rejected or expired. If a transaction is in progress (waiting for payment or analysis), PayU does not report until the transaction has a final status.

## Signature validation
The signature validation allows you to check the data integrity, you must generate the signature with the information you find in the confirmation page and compare it with the information from the signature parameter.

To validate the signature in the confirmation page, you should consider:

* If the second decimal is zero, the `new_value` to generate the signature must have one decimal. Example (`150.00` -> `150.0`).
* If the second decimal is not zero, the `new_value` to generate the signature must keep the same two decimals. Example (`150.26` -> `150.26`).
* Get the parameters to generate the signature (`merchant_id`, `reference_sale`, `value`, `currency`, and `state_pol`) from the confirmation page, do not get them from your database. 
* You must store your ApiKey safely.
* Create the signature as follows:

```HTML
"ApiKey~merchant_id~reference_sale~new_value~currency~state_pol"
```
<br>

Example

**With one decimal**

```
Your apiKey: 4Vj8eK4rloUd272L48hsrarnUA 
Parameters obtained from the confirmation page
- merchant_id = 508029
- reference_sale = TestPayU04
- value = 150.00
- currency = USD
- state_pol = 6

The signature is generated in the following way: 
MD5(4Vj8eK4rloUd272L48hsrarnUA~508029~TestPayU04~150.0~USD~6) = b607a2c2fa100e0947b206d41864fb86

sign = b607a2c2fa100e0947b206d41864fb86
```

**With two decimals**

```
Your apiKey: 4Vj8eK4rloUd272L48hsrarnUA 
Parameters obtained from the confirmation page:
- merchant_id = 508029
- reference_sale = TestPayU05
- value = 150.26
- currency = USD
- state_pol = 4

The signature is generated in the following way: 
MD5(4Vj8eK4rloUd272L48hsrarnUA~508029~TestPayU05~150.26~USD~4) = 1d95778a651e11a0ab93c2169a519cd6

sign = 1d95778a651e11a0ab93c2169a519cd6 
```

This calculator lets you generate the signature using any of the available encryption methods.

## Payment retries
When a transaction is rejected, the payer has the option to retry the payment using the same payment method or another. Keep in mind that for each attempt, PayU makes the call to the confirmation page with the corresponding transaction status.

Each of these calls are made with the same payment reference (`reference_sale`), the same order identifier (`reference_pol`) but with different transaction identifier (`transaction_id`). Therefore, you can receive several calls to the confirmation page for the same sale.

Below, you find an example of a rejected attempt and its approved retry:

````
reference_sale=2015-05-27 13:04:37
reference_pol=7069375
transaction_id=f5e668f1-7ecc-4b83-a4d1-0aaa68260862
state_pol=6

reference_sale=2015-05-27 13:04:37
reference_pol=7069375
transaction_id=01cfdce8-68d5-4a4c-aabf-d89370a0b92f
state_pol=4
````

Note that if one of those calls to the confirmation page indicates that a payment reference (`reference_sale`) was approved, you can be certain that you will not receive any report to the same reference.
