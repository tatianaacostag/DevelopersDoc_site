## How to use PayU 3DS Authentication

To use 3DS Authentication, merchants must be registered to this service with PayU. Once registered, you can include a new parameter called `req3DSAuthentication` in your payment requests via PayU's Payments API.

### The `req3DSAuthentication` parameter

This parameter allows you to control whether 3DS authentication is required for each transaction. It accepts two values:

* `"true"`: Enforces 3DS authentication for the transaction.
* `"false"`: Disables 3DS authentication for the transaction.

**If `req3DSAuthentication` is not included,** PayU will decide whether to perform 3DS authentication based on its own risk assessment.

#### Request body:
In the request example below, the `req3DSAuthentication` is set `true`:

## Transaction response and authentication flow

Upon sending a payment request, you will receive a response with a `"PENDING"` state for the transaction. This response will also include a field within `extraParameters` called `THREEDS_AUTH_REDIRECT_URL`.

* **`THREEDS_AUTH_REDIRECT_URL`:** This URL should be used to redirect the payer to complete the 3DS authentication process. The authentication process might involve challenges like entering a one-time password (OTP) received on their phone.

### Response

In the response example below, the merchant redirects the payer to `https://merch-prod.payu.com`:

```JSON
{
    "code": "SUCCESS",
    "error": null,
    "transactionResponse": {
        "orderId": 1427471957,
        "transactionId": "53dc40a4-ef00-4637-9578-941421f6fd7e",
        "state": "PENDING",
        "paymentNetworkResponseCode": null,
        "paymentNetworkResponseErrorMessage": null,
        "trazabilityCode": null,
        "authorizationCode": null,
        "pendingReason": "AWAITING_THREEDS_CALLBACK",
        "responseCode": "PENDING_THREEDS_CALLBACK",
        "errorCode": null,
        "responseMessage": null,
        "transactionDate": null,
        "transactionTime": null,
        "operationDate": 1712909903010,

        "extraParameters": {
            "BANK_REFERENCED_CODE": "CREDIT",
            "THREEDS_AUTH_REDIRECT_URL": "https://merch-prod.payu.com/threeds/?authenticationId=6c38fbd4-e643-49e6-be75-1okhfe02a71"
        },
        "additionalInfo": {
            "paymentNetwork": "CREDIBANCO_V2",
            "rejectionType": null,
            "responseNetworkMessage": null,
            "travelAgencyAuthorizationCode": null,
            "cardType": "CREDIT",
            "transactionType": "AUTHORIZATION_AND_CAPTURE"
        }
    }
}
```

## After authentication

Once the payer completes the 3DS authentication (if required), PayU will be notified. The transaction will then be:

* **Completed:** If the authentication is successful.
* **Declined:** If the authentication fails.

### Redirection after authentication

Following the payer's redirection from the `THREEDS_AUTH_REDIRECT_URL`, they will be directed to:

* **PayU Checkout transaction status page:** By default, this is the behavior if the merchant hasn't specified a custom return URL.
* **Merchant's custom return URL:** If provided, the payer will be redirected to the merchant's designated page after authentication.
