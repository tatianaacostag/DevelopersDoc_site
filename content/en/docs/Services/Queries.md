## Considerations
Before using the _Queries_ feature, take into account the following considerations:

* It is recommended to use _Queries_ for transactions in `PENDING` state.
* According to the payment method, the time to perform the query may vary. Nevertheless, it is recommended to perform the first query seven minutes after the transaction is created.
* Do not retry a query of a transaction when PayU indicates that the transaction does not exist.
* Bank transfer transactions are only available every ten minutes.

## Query criteria
To query transactions, PayU allows you to search by any of the following criteria:

* *Order Id*: it is generated by PayU. Identifies the order in PayU system and is the main element where any movement is recorded (charges, retries, refunds, etc)
* *Transaction Id*: PayU generates this identifier per each movement associated with an order (Order ID).
* *Reference Number*: it is generated by the shop. Identifies the order or purchase in your system, PayU saves this value as you send it.
