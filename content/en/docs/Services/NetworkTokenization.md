## What is PayU Network Token solution?

Network Tokenization processes card payments by replacing the card details with a network-issued token, this leads to higher approval rates and more secure sensitive customer card information. Tokenization provides an additional layer of security by replacing sensitive payment information with the unique token, thereby reducing the risk of data breaches, and enhancing customer experience.

**We offer Network Tokenization using a pass-through model.** This solution is available for Visa and Mastercard cards, specifically in Brazil and Argentina.  

To use the Tokenization feature, it is necessary to enable it in your PayU account. To do so, contact your sales representative, or if you don’t have one, please send an email to:

In a pass-through model, the merchant should tokenize the payment card in the first place with an external token requestor provider. After doing so, the merchant will be able to transact using the previously generated token as explained in the section **How does Network Tokenization work?** on this page.
