## How does PayU work?
To understand how PayU processes payments, it is important to understand two main concepts:

* Order: an order in PayU is defined as the set of movements related to an online payment.
* Transaction: any movement related to an order such as charges, retries, refunds, disputes, etc.

For example, a customer purchase a product using the your web page, the customer pays using their credit card and the payment is approved and accepted by the customer's bank; Then, the shop finds that they don't have enough stock of this product and request a refund to PayU. PayU, approves the refund and the money is returned to the customer.
In this case, the order was the purchase of the product and this order has many transactions such as, the accept of the payment, the charge, the refund approval.
