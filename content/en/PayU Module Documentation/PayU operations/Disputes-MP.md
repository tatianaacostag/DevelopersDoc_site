## Permission required
To have access to this module, you need to have a profile with the following permission enabled:

* _Reports_ > _Refunds and disputes_
* _Reports_ > _Resolve disputes with buyers (manage chargebacks)_

Refer to [Profiles and Permissions]({{< ref"Profile-and-permissions-management.md" >}}) for more information.

## Why is it important to reply to a Dispute? 
* The Merchant can generate mistrust with the client.
* If you don't address the disputes, PayU takes the amount from your account.
* The reservation fund could be higher by the risk area.
* It damages the score of the PayU code facing the payment networks.
* The disputed amount will be frozen until the dispute is solved.

It is important to reply to a dispute by providing evidence before the deadline stipulated by the bank. After the deadline, it is not possible to upload the corresponding evidence for a dispute and the amount may be debited from your account.

For more information about the deadlines defined, refer to [maximum days to provide evidence]({{< ref "disputes.md#maximum-days-to-provide-evidence" >}}).

## How to resolve disputes?
A dispute begins when a buyer does not know a charge made to their credit card. Once the bank is notified, the formal process begins to determine the validity of the purchase.

{{% alert title="Tip" color="info"%}}
If you have the cardholderâ€™s data, the best way to manage a dispute process is to contact them. If the reason for the dispute is just ignorance (the customer didn't recall the purchase or your commerce), you can ask them to call their bank to withdraw the complaint and so the dispute process is resolved in your favor.

The dispute case may result in won (no chargeback), Lost (chargeback) or refunded. In the case of refunds, the trade is who makes the return to the buyer and the bank does not generate the chargeback. Refer to [dispute states]({{< ref "Disputes.md#dispute-states" >}}) to know all the states of a dispute.

When the financial entity communicates the result of the dispute, the case is automatically updated in the PayU Module.
