## What is a refund?
A refund is the action to voluntary return the money paid by a customer when any of the following situations happen:
* The product or service delivered does not met the expectations of the customer and they returned it.
* The product is out of stock, anf the merchant is not able to deliver the product to the client.

## Refund procedure
Refunds are subject to review and approval of our team. The procedure to request refunds is explained below:

1. When a refund is requested by your customer, you need to request it using the PayU module. You just need to identify the order and provide a reason for refund.

2. Once you send the request, PayU reviews it and this is approved or rejected in **one** to **three** business days.

### Refund states
A refund can be in one of the following three states:

* **In return**: the request has been sent to PayU for approval and it is under approval.
* **Approved**: the request has been approved by a PayUâ€™s customer service agent.
* **Declined**: the request does not meet the policies defined by PayU and was rejected by an agent.

## Permission required

* _Refunds and Chargebacks_ > _List Refunds_
