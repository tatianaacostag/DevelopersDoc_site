![PrintScreen](/assets/Refunds/Refunds_en_01.png)

2. Use the _**Filter my sales**_ field to find the order using the order and the transaction id.

<img src="/assets/Refunds/Refunds_en_02.png" alt="PrintScreen" width="50%"/><br>

3. The Status column show whether the refund has been approved ou rejected; if the refund has not been approved, this column shows that the refund has been requested.

![PrintScreen](/assets/Refunds/Refunds_en_03.png)

#### Check status using queries
You can consult the state of the refund by using the [Consultas API]({{< ref "Queries-API.md" >}}). In the request of the query, you need to send the order id.

When query an order, the system returns the last transaction associated with the Order.

There are three possible status in the response of your request:
* **Unresolved request**: if the request has not been resolved, the order found in the query appears in `CAPTURED` status (parameter `result.payload.status` in the response), the first transaction type is `AUTHORIZATION_AND_CAPTURE` (parameter `result.transactions.type` in the response) and the first transaction status is `APPROVED` (First parameter `result.transactions.transactionResponse.state` in the response).
* **Approved**: if the refund request is approved by a PayU’s customer service agent, the order found in the query appears in `REFUNDED` status (parameter `result.payload.status` in the response), the first transaction type is `REFUND` (parameter `result.transactions.type` in the response) and the first transaction status is `APPROVED` (First parameter `result.transactions.transactionResponse.state` in the response).
* **Declined**: if the refund request is declined by a PayU’s customer service agent, the order found in the query appears in `CAPTURED` status (parameter `result.payload.status` in the response), the first transaction type is `REFUND` (parameter `result.transactions.type` in the response) and the first transaction status is `DECLINED` (First parameter `result.transactions.transactionResponse.state` in the response).
